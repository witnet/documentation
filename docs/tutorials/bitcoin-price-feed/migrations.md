# 7. Migrate the contracts into an Ethereum network

!!! note ""
    *This article is part of the [beginner tutorial on creating a totally
    decentralized Bitcoin price feed][intro] on Ethereum with Solidity and
    Witnet.*

## Compile your Solidity contract

First off, run the `compile` command, which compiles your Solidity
contracts and then recompiles the Witnet requests:

=== "npm"
	```console
    npm run compile
    ```

=== "yarn"
	```console
    yarn compile
    ```

## You have migration scripts by default!

Migration scripts are very useful in Truffle. They allow
you to configure how your contracts will be deployed on different
Ethereum networks, set your contract's constructor arguments and link
dynamic dependencies.

In addition to compiling your requests into Solidity, the Witnet request compiler that lives inside the Truffle box also
**wrote autogenerated migration scripts for your
contracts**. If you look at the `migrations` folder, you should find
these three files:

- `1_initial_migration.js`: basic Truffle infrastructure migrations.
- `2_witnet_core.js`: deploys all the Witnet-related contracts if
  you are deploying on a local or private network; or dynamically links
  them if you are on a public network (Ethereum Mainnet, Rinkeby or
  Görli).
- `3_user_contracts.js`: contains autogenerated migration scripts for
  your consumer contracts.
  
Let's take a look at `migrations/3_user_contracts.js`:

```js
// This file was auto-generated by the Witnet compiler; any manual changes will be overwritten except
// for the contracts' constructor arguments (you can freely edit those and the compiler will respect them).
const Witnet = artifacts.require("Witnet")
const WitnetRequestsBoardProxy = artifacts.require("WitnetRequestsBoardProxy")
const PriceFeed = artifacts.require("PriceFeed")

module.exports = function (deployer) {
  deployer.link(Witnet, [PriceFeed])
  deployer.deploy(PriceFeed, WitnetRequestsBoardProxy.address)
}
```

As you can see, the autogenerated migration script is:

1. Dynamically linking the `Witnet` library to your `PriceFeed` contract.
2. Deploying your `PriceFeed` contract.
3. Passing the address of the Witnet Bridge Interface to the `PriceFeed`
   constructor.
   
For the compiler to pass the address of the Witnet Bridge Interface to
all your consumer contracts, it is important that they have a
constructor argument called `_wbi`, just like `PriceFeed` has.
   
## Customize the constructor arguments

If your consumer contract has additional constructor arguments, the
compiler will create default values for them.

Before running any migration, please make sure you double-check the
default arguments that the compiler inserts for you, as they may not
make any sense for your specific use case.

Once you modify any constructor arguments, the compiler will not rewrite
those lines. If you mess them up or you want the compiler to generate
default values for new constructor arguments, you can just delete those
lines or remove the `3_user_contracts.js` file altogether, then run the
compiler once again.

## Run the deployment

Deploying your contract into Truffle's own local Ethereum network is as simple as executing:

```console
truffle migrate
```


Please take into account that Truffle's own local network lacks any
bridging capability with Witnet. This means that it is good for
testing the migrations, but not for testing the entire workflow of your
contracts. However, the Witnet community is working hard to overcome
this limitation so that you can test your Witnet-connected contracts
locally.

If you want to test your contracts in a more realistic environment, you
can deploy them into a public network using the `--network` flag:

- `truffle migrate --network=rinkeby` deploys on the Ethereum Rinkeby
  testnet.
- `truffle migrate --network=goerli` deploys on the Ethereum Görli
  testnet.

Deploying on Mainnet is not supported yet. Take a look at the [community
roadmap][roadmap] for more information on Mainnet support.

## Interact with your contract

The Truffle documentation has a comprehensive guide on [interacting with
your contracts][interacting].
