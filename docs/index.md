# Welcome to the Witnet ecosystem!

![alt medium |>][apis-illustration]

The Witnet protocol enables a network of computers to act as a
**decentralized oracle** that retrieves, attests and delivers
information in behalf of **smart contracts** in a **tamper-resistant**
way.

> This _Decentralized Oracle Network (DON)_ maintains and distributes a
> _block chain_ data structure that serves as a common ledger for the
> operation of the protocol as well as for the _wit_ token, which is
> central for incentivizing the network players to abide by the protocol
> and make them liable for any misbehavior. —
> [Witnet Whitepaper][whitepaper]

Active network participants **earn wit tokens** for fulfilling the data
retrieval, attestation and delivery tasks coming from different smart
contract platforms such as [Ethereum][ethereum].

## Node operators, a.k.a. *Witnesses*
The Witnet blockchain is free, open, and neutral. That is,
**[You can run your own node][run-a-node] and mine blocks on the Witnet
blockchain**. Every node maintains the history of all the transactions
on the blockchain.

Additionally, every node in the Witnet network can participate in
*witnessing*, i.e. **earning wit tokens in exchange of retrieving,
aggregating and delivering data points** from public APIs into smart
contracts.

## Developers

The Witnet ecosystem welcomes developers of all kind of backgrounds:
from people who contribute to [Witnet-Rust] or [Sheikah] to those who
want to
[connect their Ethereum smart contracts to external APIs][ethereum].
Developers can:

- Build Witnet clients.
- Build applications to interact with a Witnet client.
- Write [Ethereum smart contracts that use Witnet][ethereum].
- Contribute to [Witnet-Rust] or [Sheikah].

## Witnet Foundation

[Witnet Foundation][foundation] is the independent entity currently in
charge of funding the development of Witnet-Rust and Sheikah, as well
as fostering the thriving ecosystem around the Witnet protocol.

## Other stakeholders
The Witnet community is open to everyone. Even if you are not a
developer or node operator, there are
[many things you can do][contributing] to spread the word!
